Neon Web OS prototype

How to preview locally:
1. git checkout web-os-prototype
2. Serve the repo root (so paths resolve): python -m http.server 8000
3. Open http://localhost:8000/web-os/index.html

This branch contains a small neon-themed single-page desktop with a File Explorer, Text Editor, and a fake Terminal. It also includes a minimal service worker and manifest to test PWA install behavior.

If you want different icons, an actual wallpaper file, or additional apps I can add them in a follow-up commit.
